# Introduction

Welcome to Mastering Orchard Layouts, a book that will take us on a journey through the wonderful and exciting world of the Orchard Layouts module, which was first released as part of Orchard 1.9.

The book is divided in three parts.

**Part 1** introduces the Layouts module and looks at it from a user's perspective.

**Part 2** goes a step further and looks at the various shapes and templates from a theme developer's perspective.

**Part 3** takes a deep dive and looks at the module from a developer's point of view. Here we'll learn about extensibility and APIs, and how to create custom elements and element harvesters.

I hope you will enjoy reading this book as much as I did writing it, and that the knowledge you gain is useful in your Orchard Projects.
